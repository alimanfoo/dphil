%%
In this chapter I provide an overview of the present situation regarding malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa, the critical role played by large-scale mosquito control programmes, and the current challenges of insecticide resistance.
%
I then introduce whole-genome sequencing and describe its potential role in malaria mosquito surveillance and accelerating efforts towards the development of new mosquito control tools.
%
These factors provided the background and motivation for the establishment of the \textit{Anopheles gambiae} 1000 Genomes (Ag1000G) Project, an international collaboration to study genetic variation among malaria-transmitting mosquitoes collected from natural populations across sub-Saharan Africa.
%
This thesis describes work I contributed to phase 1 of the Ag1000G Project.

\section{Malaria vector control in sub-Saharan Africa}


%%
Malaria is an infectious disease caused by eukaryotic parasites of the genus \textit{Plasmodium} and transmitted by blood-feeding mosquitoes of the genus \textit{Anopheles}.
%
The vast majority of malaria occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 200 million cases and 400,000 deaths annually \citep{WHO2019WMR}.





%The most effective methods of controlling malaria prevent transmission by targeting the mosquito vector (malaria vector control). Two methods of malaria vector control are widely used in public health programmes in Africa: mass distribution of long-lasting insecticidal bednets (LLINs) (Carnevale and Gay 2019; Okumu @@) and indoor residual spraying of houses with insecticides (IRS) (Choi et al. 2019). At the turn of the millenium, a concerted international campaign and partnership was launched with the goal of dramatically increasing the scale and scope of malaria vector control programmes in sub-Saharan Africa [Nabarro1998]. Since then, more than 2 billion LLINs have been distributed in total, exceeding 100 million LLINs annually [AMP2020] with more than 40% of the population at risk sleeping under an LLIN from 2014 onwards [Bhatt2015; WHO2019]. IRS programmes are more targeted and reserved for focal areas of higher malaria transmission, but are nevertheless substantial, protecting more than 10% of the population at risk in 2010, although declining to lower levels since [Bhatt2015; WHO2019; Tangena2020]. The impact of these vector control programmes has been substantial. The prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum infection in Africa halved between 2000 and 2015, averting approximately 663 million clinical cases, of which 68% can be attributed to LLIN and IRS interventions [Bhatt2015].
