In this chapter I provide an overview of the present situation regarding malaria control in sub-Saharan Africa, the critical role played by large-scale mosquito control programmes, and the current challenges of insecticide resistance.
%
I then introduce whole-genome sequencing and describe its potential role in malaria mosquito surveillance and accelerating efforts towards the development of new mosquito control tools.
%
These factors provided the background and motivation for the establishment of the \textit{Anopheles gambiae} 1000 Genomes (Ag1000G) Project, an international collaboration to study genetic variation among malaria-transmitting mosquitoes collected from natural populations across sub-Saharan Africa.
%
This thesis describes work I contributed to phase 1 of the Ag1000G Project.

\section{Malaria vector control in sub-Saharan Africa}


%%
Malaria is an infectious disease caused by eukaryotic parasites of the genus \textit{Plasmodium} and transmitted by blood-feeding mosquitoes of the genus \textit{Anopheles}.
%
The vast majority of malaria occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, with more than 200 million cases and 400,000 deaths annually \citep{WHO2019WMR}.
%
The most effective methods of controlling malaria prevent disease transmission by targeting the mosquito vector (malaria vector control).
%
Two methods of malaria vector control are widely used in public health programmes in Africa: mass distribution of long-lasting insecticidal bednets (LLINs)
\citep{Carnevale2019,Okumu2020} and indoor residual spraying of houses with insecticides (IRS) \citep{WHO2006IRS,Pluess2010,Choi2019}.
%
At the turn of the millenium, a concerted international campaign and partnership was launched with the goal of dramatically increasing the scale and scope of malaria vector control programmes in sub-Saharan Africa \citep{Nabarro1998}.
%
Since then, more than 2 billion LLINs have been distributed in total, exceeding 100 million LLINs annually \citep{AMP2020} with more than 40\% of the population at risk sleeping under an LLIN from 2014 onwards \citep{Bhatt2015,WHO2019WMR}.
%
IRS programmes are more targeted and reserved for focal areas of higher malaria transmission, but are nevertheless substantial, protecting more than 10\% of the population at risk in 2010, although declining to lower levels since \citep{Bhatt2015,WHO2019WMR,Tangena2020}. 
%
The impact of these vector control programmes has been substantial. 
%
The prevalence of \textit{Plasmodium falciparum} malaria infections in Africa halved between 2000 and 2015, averting approximately 663 million clinical cases, of which 68\% can be attributed to LLIN and IRS interventions \citep{Bhatt2015}.

\section{The threat of insecticide resistance}


%%
All LLINs approved for public health use by the World Health Organization (WHO) use a pyrethroid insecticide \citep{Elliott1989} as the primary active ingredient \citep{WHO2020PQVC}. 
%
The majority of countries with IRS programmes have also primarily used pyrethroid insecticides \citep{WHO2019WMR,Tangena2020}.
%
The heavy reliance on a single insecticide class has inevitably led to a substantial increase in the prevalence of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides among African malaria vectors \citep{Hemingway2016}. 
%
Pyrethroid resistance is conventionally monitored via standardised bioassays, and resistance is detected when the proportion of mosquitoes killed by a diagnostic dose falls below a standard threshold \citep{WHO2018TPIRM}. 
%
Many countries routinely perform these insecticide resistance bioassays as part of entomological monitoring programmes. 
%
When these bioassay data have been aggregated, there is a clear trend of increasing pyrethroid resistance since 2000 within the major African malaria vector species \citep{Hancock2020}. 
%
This trend is particularly acute in West Africa where, for example, it is estimated that more than 80\% of the region has resistance to the pyrethroid deltamethrin since 2010. 
%%


%%
Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides in malaria vectors clearly has the potential to reduce the efficacy of LLIN and IRS programmes.
%
In practice, however, it has not been straightforward to demonstrate or measure this reduction in efficacy.
%
A WHO-coordinated observational study in four African countries and India found no evidence that pyrethroid resistance had any effect on malaria infection prevalence or disease incidence in areas using pyrethroid LLINs as the primary intervention \citep{Kleinschmidt2018}.
%
On the other hand, several studies have found that switching IRS programmes from pyrethroids to a different insecticide class has led to a significant reduction in disease \citep{Hargreaves2000,Kafy2017}. 
%
Using non-pyrethroid IRS in addition to pyrethroid LLINs, or using newer LLINs that combine a pyrethroid with the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO) that counteracts some forms of pyrethroid resistance, have also been shown to reduce disease relative to pyrethroid-only LLINs alone \citep{Protopopoff2018}. 
%
Mathematical modelling of aggregated data from bioassays and experimental hut trials has also provided evidence that non-pyrethroid IRS substantially reduces malaria relative to pyrethroid IRS \citep{SherrardSmith2018} and that PBO LLINs are more effective than pyrethroid-only LLINs in areas with pyrethroid resistance \citep{Churcher2016}.
%
There is a growing consensus that pyrethroid resistance now poses a significant threat to malaria vector control programmes, and is at least in part responsible for the fact that malaria prevalence has not substantially reduced in sub-Saharan Africa since 2014 and has increased in some countries \citep{Hemingway2016,WHO2019WMR}. 
%%

\section{Insecticide resistance management}


%%
Recognising this trend of rising pyrethroid resistance and anticipating the threat to malaria vector control, the WHO developed a global plan for insecticide resistance management (GPIRM) \citep{WHO2012GPIRM}. 
%
The ultimate goal of insecticide resistance management (IRM) is to maintain the effectiveness of insecticides by preventing or delaying the evolution and spread of resistance mutations in mosquito populations. 
%
IRM principles and strategies have been developed and established in agricultural pest management, and these have largely formed the basis for malaria vector IRM recommendations \citep{Georghiou2005,Sternberg2018}. 
%
In general, there are three main IRM strategies:
%
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item \textbf{Management by moderation}. Reducing insecticide use by using them in conjunction with a range of non-insecticide-based control measures. For malaria vectors, this is also known as integrated vector management (IVM), and includes measures such as larval source management.
%
\item \textbf{Management by saturation}. Ensure that insecticides are delivered in a way that overwhelms the insect's natural defenses. For malaria vectors, this includes using synergists such as PBO that inhibit resistance mechanisms within LLINs, and  IRS formulations that use microencapsulation to increase the dose received on contact.
%
\item \textbf{Management by multiple attack}. Employ multiple insecticides with different modes of action. Specific strategies available for malaria vectors include LLINs impregnated with two different insecticides; IRS formulations that are mixtures of two different insecticides; and IRS programmes that regularly rotate treatments between different insecticides. This can also include deployment of both LLINs and IRS in the same location using different insecticides.
%
\end{enumerate}
%
These strategies form pillar \RN{1} of the GPIRM.
%%


%%
When the GPIRM was published in 2012, there were practical limitations on the range of possible IRM strategies for malaria vector control, because the only LLIN products available all used a single pyrethroid active ingredient, and a limited range of IRS products were available spanning four insecticide classes and two modes of action.
%
More recently, a ``next-generation'' of dual active ingredient LLIN products have been approved for public health use, including PBO LLINs \citep{Gleave2018} and LLINs that combine a pyrethroid with a second insecticide with a different mode of action \citep{Bayili2017,Tiono2018}.
%
A ``next-generation'' of IRS products have also become available, including a microencapsulation formulation of the organophosphate insecticide pyrimiphos methyl \citep{Oxborough2014}, and products using the neonicotinoid insecticide clothianidin not previously used in public health \citep{Oxborough2019}.
%
These new products have opened up new possibilities for malaria vector IRM.
%
Malaria control programmes began rotating IRS programmes to use next-generation IRS products from 2016 \citep{Tangena2020} and several initiatives are working to accelerate the deployment of next-generation LLINs\footnote{http://unitaid.org/call-for-proposal/catalyzing-market-introduction-next-generation-long-lasting-insecticidal-nets-llins/}$^{,}$\footnote{https://www.ivcc.com/market-access/new-nets-project/}.
%
These changes represent the most significant upheaval in malaria vector control strategy since the turn of the millenium, and present both new opportunities and new challenges.
%
In particular, the use of new insecticides will inevitably exert new selective pressures on malaria vector populations, and the emergence and spread of new forms of resistance is a major concern.
%
Also, next-generation LLIN and IRS products are more expensive and can be logistically more demanding \citep{TenBrink2018}.
%
Thus choices need to be made about where, when and how to deploy these new products to get maximum impact from limited resources without reducing the number of people protected from malaria infection \citep{WHO2017PBOLLIN}.
%%


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Surveillance as a core intervention}


%%
Data are thus needed to guide decisions regarding optimal vector control strategies in different settings, to evaluate the success and impact of interventions and resistance management strategies, and to provide early warning of new evolutionary adaptations in response to the deployment of next-generation LLIN and IRS products.
%
Recognising this need, the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030 advocates that malaria surveillance should be transformed into a core intervention as one of three pillars of the strategy \citep{WHO2015GTS}.
%
Here ``surveillance'' covers a broad range of data gathering activities, encompassing both epidemiological and entomological variables, in addition to intervention coverage, available resources, trends in health service utilisation, and more. 
%
Vector surveillance, also known as entomological monitoring, is a critical component of this, gathering data on malaria vector populations.
%
Vector surveillance programmes are established to a varying degree in most malaria-endemic countries and typically collect data on which malaria vector species are present, their abundance and seasonality, their behaviour in terms of time and location of biting and host preference, as well as the susceptibility of each vector species to different insecticides \citep{Russell2020}.
%
The GPIRM emphasizes the need for insecticide resistance monitoring as pillar \RN{2} of its action plan \citep{WHO2012GPIRM}.
%%


%%
Current malaria vector surveillance programmes have two key limitations.
%
The first is that surveillance programmes are not sufficiently resourced, and thus there is a lack of trained personnel and facilities \citep{Russell2020}.
%
The second is that surveillance programmes generally do not have the capability to gather genetic data on malaria vector populations, and where they do the data are limited in resolution.
%
These data gaps mean that a number of key operational questions cannot be effectively answered, including but not limited to the following:
\begin{enumerate}
%
\item \textbf{Detecting cryptic vector species}. 
%
Malaria vector species occur within cryptic species complexes, where morphological identification is not sufficient to resolve species identity \citep{Davidson1964,Coetzee2013}. 
%
Failure to differentiate known species or recognise the presence of previously unknown species means that other data variables become muddled, because different species within the same complex may have different behaviours and/or insecticide resistance adaptations.
%
\item \textbf{Differentiating molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance}.
%
The presence of insecticide resistance can be detected by standard WHO or CDC bioassays, but these do not provide information regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms of resistance that are present in a given malaria vector population \citep{WHO2018TPIRM}.
%
Given that a number of new vector control products such as PBO LLINs are designed to target a specific mechanism of resistance, the absence of these data means there is no way to determine whether or not such a product should be deployed.
%
\item \textbf{Providing early warning of novel insecticide resistance adaptations}.
%
There is limited ability to obtain early warning of novel insecticide resistance adaptations, such as those emerging in response to deployment of a new IRS or LLIN products, because resistance typically has to reach a relatively high frequency within a mosquito population before it becomes evident via conventional bioassays @@REF.
%
\item \textbf{Monitoring of insecticide resistance allele frequencies}.
%
IRM strategies such as IRS rotation depend on managing the frequency of insecticide resistance alleles within mosquito populations, switching products at the right time and using them for the right duration to ensure resistance does not reach fixation @@REF. 
%
However, without any data on resistance allele frequencies, there is no way to know if IRM strategies are working as intended.
%
\item \textbf{Tracking the spread of insecticide resistance}. 
%
Mosquitoes move and have the capability to spread insecticide resistance over the course of multiple generations of movement and reproduction @@REF.
%
Without genetic data, it is not possible to resolve whether resistance has originated locally or spread from elsewhere.
%
Thus it is hard to determine which interventions or conditions are driving the emergence of resistance, and whether IRM strategies can be designed locally or need to be coordinated nationally or even internationally to be effective.
%
\end{enumerate}
%
An awareness of these gaps, coupled with the rapid advancement of high throughput technologies for genome sequencing and other molecular diagnostics, and the development and maturation of genomic epidemiology as a field of research, has driven an interest in the development of molecular tools for malaria vector surveillance.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{New vector control tools}

 
%%
Even if next-generation LLIN and IRS products are widely deployed, IRM strategies are implemented, and these are supported by improved vector surveillance capabilities, there is a consensus that this will not be sufficient to reach malaria elimination.
%
New vector control tools will be required, and the need for expanding research to accelerate the development of new tools is recognised as pillar \RN{3} of the GPIRM \citep{WHO2012GPIRM} and as supporting element 1 of the WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030 \citep{WHO2015GTS}.
%
This includes further repurposing of agricultural insecticides, as well as the development of new insecticides with novel modes of action designed specifically for public health use \citep{Hemingway2006,Lees2019}.
%
This also includes the development novel control tools that do not rely on insecticides, such as genetic control tools \citep{Davidson1974,Burt2003}.
%
In particular, CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology had enabled the development of highly effective gene drives, which are selfish genetic elements with the capability to spread through mosquito populations via super-Mendelian inheritance and cause population suppression or modification \citep{Kyrou2018}.
%
The development of these novel vector control tools has benefited greatly from and continues to rely upon high throughput molecular tools such as whole-genome sequencing, and the availability of high quality open access molecular data resources such as reference genome sequences for malaria vectors @@REF.
%
Increasingly, the value of and need for data on natural genetic variation in targeted mosquito populations is also becoming evident.
%
For example, CRISPR/Cas9 gene drives need to target regions of low genetic diversity to minimise the evolution of resistance @@REF.
%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Next-generation sequencing as a tool for genomic epidemiology and infectious disease surveillance}


%%
High throughput ``next-generation'' genome sequencing (NGS) technologies have advanced rapidly in the last two decades, opening up new applications for the study and control of infectious diseases.
%
The fundamental innovation of NGS is to perform sequencing of up to millions of small fragments of DNA in parallel @@REF.
%
For example, in 2005 the Illumina Genome Analyzer was the first commercially available NGS instrument, capable of generating 1 gigabase (Gb) of data per run @@REF.
%
The Illumina HiSeq instruments available from 2011 extended this capability by two orders of magnitude, generating up to 600 Gb per run.
%
These leaps in data generating capability, coupled with the corresponding reduction in per-unit sequencing costs, allow for the sequencing of many individuals of a given species, and thus the study of genetic variation within and between natural populations.
%
The 1000 Genomes Project pioneered the use of NGS for the study of genetic variation, sequencing the genomes of @@N individuals from @@M human populations, and making the data openly available as a resource for the research community @@REFs.
%
Applied to infectious diseases, NGS allows pathogen genomes from many individual infections to be sequenced and compared, providing opportunities to discover genetic variation underlying important traits such as virulence or drug resistance @@REF.
%
Comparing genome sequences also reveals patterns of relatedness between pathogens in different hosts, which can be used to analyse the origins and transmission paths of epidemic diseases such as Ebola @@REF and COVID-19 @@REF, or the transmission dynamics of endemic diseases such as malaria @@REF.
%
To promote the application of NGS to malaria research, the Malaria Genomic Epidemiology Network (MalariaGEN) was established in 200@, and provides a framework for collaboration and equitable data sharing between multiple research centres and public health laboratories. 
%
The @@TODO something about first MalariaGEN P. falciparum paper, how many genomes, what it shows.
%
@@TODO something about subsequent papers, highlighting origins and spread of artemisinin resistance in GMS.
%
Given these successes with use of NGS to study infectious disease pathogens, natural to ask whether could also be used for disease vectors, such as Anopheles mosquitoes that transmit malaria.
