\section*{Introduction}


%%
Pyrethroids are a class of synthetic insecticides, based on a natural compound pyrethrin found in the flowers of pyrethrum (\textit{Chrysanthemum}) plants \parencite{Elliott1989}.
%
Pyrethroids suitable for commercial use in agriculture and public health were discovered in the 1970s, including permethrin \parencite{Elliott1973} and deltamethrin \parencite{Elliott1974}.
%
These compounds have a high toxicity to insects but relatively low toxicity to mammals, and are photostable but do not accumulate to contaminate the environment.
%
Pyrethroids were approved for use in public health by the WHO pesticide evaluation scheme (WHOPES) in @@year @@cite.
%
Initially they were proposed for using in space and residual spraying, however it was also found that they could be impregnated into bed-nets @@cite.
%
Several landmark clinical trials during the 1980s showed that the use of pyrethroid-treated bed-nets caused a significant reduction in malaria @@cite.
%
Advances in net manufacturing subsequently allowed the development of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) which retained insecticidal activity for up to 3 years without retreatment @@cite.
%
Pyrethroid LLINs thus became the cornerstone of efforts to scale up malaria control interventions in Africa, led by the Roll Back Malaria Consortium, beginning in 1998 @@cite.
%
Those efforts have continued to expand, and in 2018, 200 million pyrethroid LLINs were distributed for free in Africa, by the Global Fund and other international partner organisations @@cite.
%
The widespread use of pyrethroid LLINs has undoudtedly had a major impact on malaria burden, with models based on data aggregated from studies in Africa between 2000 and 2015 estimating that LLINs account for @@what fraction of the reduction in malaria cases @@cite.

%% paragraph introducing history resistance to Pyrethroids
The first reports of resistance to pyrethroids among malaria vector populations were made during the 1980s.
%
For example, in @@examples of early resistance reports.
%
These reports coincided with the widespread adoption of pyrethroids in agriculture, and with the increased availability of personal and household protection products using pyrethroids @@verify @@cite.
%
As LLIN distribution was scaled up in Africa from 1998 onwards, malaria control programmes were encouraged to regularly test vector populations for evidence of pyrethroid resistance, via standardised bioassays @@cite.
%
As those data have accumulated, it is clear that the geographical extent of pyrethroid resistance among malaria vector populations has substantially increased in the last 20 years @@cite.
%
For example, @@example of areas where prevalence of resistance has increased.
%
Pyrethroids remain an essential component of all LLIN products currently approved for public health use, and thus resistance to pyrethroids is viewed as a serious challenge to the efficacy of future malaria control efforts @@cite.

%% paragraph introducing VGSC and the pyrethroid mode of action
%
Pyrethroids disrupt the insect nervous system, causing paralysis ("knock-down") and then death @@cite.
%
Pyrethroid molecules interact with the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC), an essential protein which propagates nerve impulses via action potentials @@cite.
%
In the presence of a pyrethroid, VGSC proteins @@describe physiological effect, as shown via oocyte experiments @@cite, suggesting @@what the gating function is disrupted and resting potential cannot be restored.
%
Molecular modelling studies have predicted two independent pyrethroid binding sites within the channel pore @@cite.
%
The VGSC protein sequence of \textit{Anopheles gambiae}, the major vector of malaria in Africa, comprises @@N amino acids and has a high degree of homology with sequences from other insect species @@cite.
%
Transcriptional variation has been found, with several exons being optional or having optional extensions, again similar to other insects @@cite.

%
Pyrethroid resistance in malaria vectors thus presents both a public health emergency and a phenomenon of great biological interest.
%
Opportunity to observe natural selection in action at the scale of an entire continent, within mosquito species that themselves span a broad range of ecosystems and exhibit complex population structure.
%
Study the factors that lead to increased selective pressure and the conditions that predispose populations to the rapid evolution and fixation of resistance alleles.
%
Reveal the connectivity between populations, we can watch the geographical spread of resistance in the same way that one might watch the spread of an outbreak of an infectious disease with multiple outbreak foci.
%
Also opportunity to observe molecular evolution, within a gene that has been massively conserved across insects, is now rapidly exploring a new molecular landscape of adaptation.
%
Watch the interplay of molecular function and constraint with selective pressure, as mutations accumulate and combine, sending the protein perhaps irreversibly into an entirely new evolutionary trajectory.
