\section*{Introduction}


%%
Pyrethroids are a class of synthetic insecticides, based on a natural compound pyrethrin found in the flowers of pyrethrum (\textit{Chrysanthemum}) plants \parencite{Elliott1989}.
%
Pyrethroids suitable for commercial use in agriculture and public health were discovered in the 1970s, including permethrin \parencite{Elliott1973} and deltamethrin \parencite{Elliott1974}.
%
These compounds have a high toxicity to insects but relatively low toxicity to mammals, and are photostable but do not accumulate to contaminate the environment.
%
Pyrethroids were approved for use in public health by the WHO pesticide evaluation scheme (WHOPES) in @@year @@cite.
%
Initially they were proposed for using in space and residual spraying, however it was also found that they could be impregnated into bed-nets @@cite.
%
Several landmark clinical trials during the 1980s showed that the use of pyrethroid-treated bed-nets caused a significant reduction in malaria @@cite.
%
Advances in net manufacturing subsequently allowed the development of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) which retained insecticidal activity for up to 3 years without retreatment @@cite.
%
Pyrethroid LLINs thus became the cornerstone of efforts to scale up malaria control interventions in Africa, led by the Roll Back Malaria Consortium, beginning in 1998 @@cite.
%
Those efforts have continued to expand, and in 2018, 200 million pyrethroid LLINs were distributed for free in Africa, by the Global Fund and other international partner organisations @@cite.
%
The widespread use of pyrethroid LLINs has undoudtedly had a major impact on malaria burden, with modelling work by the Malaria Atlas Project suggesting that LLINs account for @@what fraction of the reduction in malaria cases between 2000 and 2015.
