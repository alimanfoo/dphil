\begin{abstract}


Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides is a serious challenge for malaria vector control in Africa, because pyrethroids remain a vital component of all long-lasting insecticidal bed-nets currently available for public health use.
%
Target-site resistance to pyrethroids involves nucleotide substitutions in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene (\textit{Vgsc}), which encodes an essential component of the insect nervous system and the binding target for pyrethroid molecules.
%
In this chapter, I use genome variation data from phase one of the Ag1000G project to study the molecular evolution and geographical spread of pyrethroid target-site resistance among nine mosquito populations.
%
I describe non-synonymous nucleotide variation throughout the entire gene coding sequence, including both known and novel polymorphisms, and report population allele frequencies and patterns of linkage disequilibrium.
%
I then analyse the genetic backgrounds on which resistance alleles are found, to look for evidence of the geographical spread of resistance via contemporary gene flow, and to confirm positive selection for resistance alleles.
%
I conclude by identifying a smaller subset of marker SNPs which could be used to track the further spread of resistance via low-cost high-throughput genetic assays.
%
These analyses show that the molecular basis of pyrethroid target-site resistance is substantially more complex and diverse than previously appreciated in these species, and demonstrate that long-distance gene flow between countries and adaptive introgression between species are both playing a major part in the rising prevalence of resistance alleles.
